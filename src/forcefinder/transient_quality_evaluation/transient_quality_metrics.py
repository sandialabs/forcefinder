    """
    Selects the correct datasets from an SPR object and splits the data into frames 
    for the transient response prediction quality metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spr_object : TransientSourcePathReceiver
        The SPR object to pull the data from.
    channel_set : str, optional
        The channel set to make the response comparisons between.
        The available options are:
            - training (default) - This compares the responses for the 
            transformed training DOFs in the SPR object.
            - validation - This compares the responses for the validation
            response DOFs in the SPR object.
            - target - This compares the responses for all the target 
            response DOFs in the SPR object. 
    samples_per_frame : int, optional
        Number of samples in each measurement frame to compute the RMS 
        for. Either this argument or `frame_length` must be specified.  
        If both or neither are specified, a `ValueError` is raised. This 
        argument matches the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    frame_length : float, optional
        Length of each measurement frame to compute the RMS for, in the 
        same units as the `time_abscissa` field (`samples_per_frame` = `frame_length`/`self.time_abscissa_spacing`).
        Either this argument or `samples_per_frame` must be specified. If
        both or neither are specified, a `ValueError` is raised. This 
        argument matches the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    overlap : float, optional
        Fraction of the measurement frame to overlap (i.e. 0.25 not 25 to
        overlap a quarter of the frame) for the RMS calculation. Either 
        this argument or `overlap_samples` must be specified. If both are
        specified, a `ValueError` is raised.  If neither are specified, no
        overlap is used. This argument matches the behavior of the 
        "split_into_frames" method.
    overlap_samples : int, optional
        Number of samples in the measurement frame to overlap for the RMS
        calculation. Either this argument or `overlap_samples` must be 
        specified.  If both are specified, a `ValueError` is raised.  If 
        neither are specified, no overlap is used. This argument matches 
        the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    window : str, optional
        The window to apply to the segmented data. This should a window that 
        is available from the `scipy.signal.get_window` function. The default
        is boxcar.  

    Returns
    -------
    truth : TimeHistoryArray
        The truth response, segmented into frames per the selected options.
    reconstructed : TimeHistoryArray
        The reconstructed response, segmented into frames per the selected options.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This returns the raw training response rather than the reconstructed training 
    response.

            response DOFs in the SPR object.
            - target - This compares the responses for all the target 
            response DOFs in the SPR object. 
    samples_per_frame : int, optional
        Number of samples in each measurement frame to compute the RMS 
        for. Either this argument or `frame_length` must be specified.  
        If both or neither are specified, a `ValueError` is raised. This 
        argument matches the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    frame_length : float, optional
        Length of each measurement frame to compute the RMS for, in the 
        same units as the `time_abscissa` field (`samples_per_frame` = `frame_length`/`self.time_abscissa_spacing`).
        Either this argument or `samples_per_frame` must be specified. If
        both or neither are specified, a `ValueError` is raised. This 
        argument matches the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    overlap : float, optional
        Fraction of the measurement frame to overlap (i.e. 0.25 not 25 to
        overlap a quarter of the frame) for the RMS calculation. Either 
        this argument or `overlap_samples` must be specified. If both are
        specified, a `ValueError` is raised.  If neither are specified, no
        overlap is used. This argument matches the behavior of the 
        "split_into_frames" method.
    overlap_samples : int, optional
        Number of samples in the measurement frame to overlap for the RMS
        calculation. Either this argument or `overlap_samples` must be 
        specified.  If both are specified, a `ValueError` is raised.  If 
        neither are specified, no overlap is used. This argument matches 
        the behavior of the "split_into_frames" method.
    window : str, optional
        The window to apply to the segmented data. This should a window that 
        is available from the `scipy.signal.get_window` function. The default
        is hann.
    normalize_by_rms : bool, option
        Whether or not to normalize the error magnitudes (at each time slice) 
        by the relative magnitude of the RMS level (for each DOF) of the truth
        data. The normalization can help show the relative significance of the 
        spectrum error based on the amplitude of the time response (the errors 
        are scaled down where the RMS level is small). The default is false. 

    Returns
