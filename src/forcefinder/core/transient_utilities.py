    """
    Identifies and creates several parameters that will be used when zero
    padding the data in a transient source estimation problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spr_object : TransientSourcePathReceiver
        The transient SPR object that is being used for the source estimation
        problem. 
    cola_frame_length : int, optional
        The frame length (in samples) for the COLA processing. The default frame 
        length is approximately Fs/df from the FRFs.
    cola_window : string, float, or tuple
        The window to use in the COLA processing. This input is passed directly to 
        the SciPy get_window function. The default is a Tukey window with an alpha 
        of 0.5.
    cola_overlap_samples : int, optional
        The overlap (in samples) between the frames in the COLA processing, such that
        cola_overlap_samples/cola_frame_length results in the overlap percentage. A
        default is defined for the default Tukey window.

    Returns
    -------
    padded_response : ndarray
        The training response of the SPR object with zero padding on the start and 
        end, to account for the windowing in the COLA procedure. It is shaped 
        [number of samples, number of responses].
    signal_sizes : dict
        The various signal sizes that were used in the zero padding operation. The
        dictionary includes the following keys: 
            - pre_data_blank_frame_length - The amount of zeros that were added to 
            the beginning of the training response to enable a perfect COLA 
            reconstruction.
            - post_data_blank_frame_length - The amount of zeros that were added to 
            the end of the training response to enable a perfect COLA reconstruction.
            - left_zero_pad_length - The amount of zeros that were used to pad the 
            left side of the COLA frames.

            the COLA processing.
            - cola_frame_length - The frame length (in samples) that was use for the 
            COLA processing (corresponds to the cola_frame_length input parameter).
            - cola_overlap_samples - The overlap (in samples) between the frames in 
            the COLA processing (corresponds to the cola_overlap_samples input parameter).
            - zero_padded_signal_length - The frame length (in samples) of each zero 
            padded COLA frame. 
    frame_indices : ndarray
        The indices to segment the padded_response into the COLA frames. It is shaped
        [number of frames, cola frame length]. 
    window : ndarray

    Notes
    -----
    The zero_padded_signal_length is determined by an algorithm that uses the SciPy 
    next_fast_len function, which can return an odd length. Care should be taken when 
    reconstructing the signal with an inverse FFT.

    """
    Reconstructs a full time signal from cola frame FFTs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cola_ffts : ndarray
        The cola frame FFTs to reconstruct the signal from. It should be sized
        [number of frames, number of frequency lines, number of DOFs]
    signal_sizes : dict
        The various signal sizes that were used in the original COLA segmentation 
        and zero padding operation. The dictionary should include the following keys: 
            - pre_data_blank_frame_length - The amount of zeros that were added to 
            the beginning of the training response to enable a perfect COLA 
            reconstruction.
            - post_data_blank_frame_length - The amount of zeros that were added to 
            the end of the training response to enable a perfect COLA reconstruction.
            - left_zero_pad_length - The amount of zeros that were used to pad the 
            left side of the COLA frames. 
            - right_zero_pad_length - The amount of zeros that were used to pad the 
            right side of the COLA frames. 
            - cola_frame_length - The frame length (in samples) that was use for the 
            COLA processing (corresponds to the cola_frame_length input parameter).
            - cola_overlap_samples - The overlap (in samples) between the frames in 
            the COLA processing (corresponds to the cola_overlap_samples input parameter).
            - zero_padded_signal_length - The frame length (in samples) of each zero 
            padded COLA frame. 
    return_signal_length : int
        The desired number of samples in the returned signal. 
    cola_window : ndarray
        The window (as a 1d array) that was used in the original COLA segmentation.

    Returns
    -------
    reconstructed_signal : ndarray
        The reconstructed signal, it is sized [number of samples, number of DOFs]
